5. Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
6. 
7. - What was your motivation?
8. - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
9. - What problem does it solve?
10. - What did you learn?
11. 
12. ## Table of Contents (Optional)

14. If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
15. 
16. - [Installation](#installation)
17. - [Usage](#usage)
18. - [Credits](#credits)
19. - [License](#license)

25. ## Usage
26. 
27. Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
28. 
29. To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

32. 
33. ## Credits
34. 
35. List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

39. If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
40. 
41. ## License
42. 
43. The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

53. Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

55. ## Features
56. 
57. If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

59. ## How to Contribute
60. 
61. If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

63. ## Tests

65. Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
