# Technology-Blog

## Description
The following project was completed as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development Bootcamp. The aim was to create a content management system for blog posts regarding technology which would allow anybody to sign up and make their own posts to be seenb by other users. By doing so I was able to consolidate my understanding of the MVC paradigm and implemement it for this assignment. This challenge also acted as a great review for Object Relation Models, Route handling and as an introduction to templating engines such as handlebars.js. This has therefore been my first complete fullstack application that also utilises session storage and cookies to log in, log out and create users.

Overall, this has been a great exercise in understanding how to maintain a separation of concerns and how to structure a Fullstack Application.
